- The file calibration contains the detailed procedures and results of data acquisition and parameter calibration described in Section 5. The implementation is in Python.
- The file basket_K_change includes the detailed implementation in R for pricing basket options using Theorems 1â€“5.
- The file basketspread_K_change contains the R code for pricing basket spread options based on Theorem 5 and Remark 2.
- The files basket_K_change_MC_control and basketspread_K_change_MC_control provide the Matlab implementations of Monte Carlo simulations for pricing basket options and basket spread options, respectively, using the pricing formula in Theorem 5 as a control variate.
